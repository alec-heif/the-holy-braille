The Holy Braille
=======================
An app that allows you to take a photo, does edge detection and other blob recognition algorithms to recognize Braille dots or clusters, and translates the Braille as well as reads it aloud. Built with OpenCV for Android and was both of our first foray into both Android and Computer Vision.

Originally inspired by puzzle hunts where puzzles or answers will often be given in Braille, requiring lots of manual transcription.
